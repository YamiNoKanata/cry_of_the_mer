## Kapitel 1:
Beep. Beep. Beep.

My nose scrunches and I moan softly, disturbed by the incessant beeping. What is that? I crack open my eyelids and my vision is instantly assaulted by a harsh light overhead. I blink rapidly to adjust to the bright room. I freeze. This isn’t my bedroom and it’s certainly not my bed. I turn my head to the side. The walls are concrete, a basement perhaps, and chalk white. I’m lying on a metal table and my headache is growing rapidly more noticeable. I go to move off the table when I learn I am unable to move at all. It is then that I become aware of the feeling of rough leather chafing the skin of my wrists and ankles; both of which are secured to the unyielding surface.

Panic begins to build inside me, rising in a heavy lump in my throat. I shiver against the draft in the room. It doesn’t take me long to realize I’m wearing nothing under the scratchy and thin, hospital-style sheet that’s draped over my body. Is that where I am? The hospital? Did something happen? Though it doesn’t really explain the metal table, it could certainly explain the restraints. Perhaps I hit my head and most of this is a hallucination.

There’s the click of a door handle being turned and I just manage to see the door swing open through my peripheral vision. I can’t help but pull futilely at my restraints, despite the fact that if I am injured; moving probably isn’t helping.

“Relax, there’s no need for that,” a man’s voice says, moments before the owner enters my line of sight. It’s an older man, who is balding badly at the front of his scalp. Patches of salt and pepper hair cling around his ears. Dark brown eyes are framed by a pair of rectangular, thick-rimmed glasses that look like they’re pushed a little further up his nose than they need to be. A clipboard is hugged under one arm.

“Who are you? Where are we? What happened?” My voice is hoarse, but I force the questions out nonetheless.

“I will explain everything to you, I find keeping people in the loop is so much easier than listening to them fret. All of your questions will receive answers, but first, there is something I need from you. I need you to confirm some information for me, do you think you can do that?”

I chew the inside of my cheek but nod.

“Excellent. So we’ll start with your name, Katherine Waters, yes? Middle name Loraine?”

“Yes,” I reply. “But I prefer Katie.”

The man grunts in acknowledgement. “How old are you?”

“Sixteen, as of yesterday.” I think. What day is it?

“I would presume you mean Tuesday, you’ve been asleep for the past twenty-four hours. Your biological parents are not in the picture correct, one diseased, the other-”

“Not in the picture,” I acknowledge.

“And your guardian, Sophie Brooks right? Does she know where you were headed the other day?”

“Yes.”

“Which was where?”

“The docks by the south beach. I was meeting a client. They hired me for an underwater excursion and photography session. We were supposed to be gone all day. What happened? Was there an accident? Is that why I’m here?”

The man chuckles and the sound sends chills down my spine. “Oh no, I can assure you, you are in perfect physical and mental health.”

“Then why am I here?” A touch of terror enters my voice.

“Relax, did I not promise you answers? If you’ll turn your head to the left, you’ll see a screen.” I comply and sure enough, there’s an overhead projector and a screen covering half the wall. “This is a high security multinational, billion-dollar research facility, the Lemuria Institution. We are the leading founders of many of today’s scientific discoveries. This is our Oceanarium building.”

A stone settles in the pit of my stomach. I don’t like where this is heading. “Um-”

“Hush. Please, save your questions for the end. Now, six years ago, we made an extraordinary find. One that, when released, will rewrite our history books. An aquatic, humanoid creature.”

“Like a mermaid?” I ask skeptically.

“Precisely. It may seem difficult to believe, but to our complete shock, one childhood fantasy is not so mythical. However, because of the rare nature of the specimen, we have not been able to publicize any of this information. For all we know it could be the only of its kind. And unless we can find another, a companion, we cannot open an exhibit without getting hell from environmentalists, and we cannot release it due to its time already in captivity and the fact that it could be critically endangered and is better off in our care. So, we are faced with a dilemma that, until recently, was unsolvable. But we are in luck. Over the past two years we have been extracting DNA from our aquatic friend in a safe manner that leaves no permanent damage to the host. We have been experimenting with cross-genetics and have been quite successful with many of our specimens. You see, if we cannot locate another merperson, for lack of better term, then we plan to create one. And we’ve perfected the formula. Now all that’s left is to graft the new DNA into a host. A human host. That, my dear, is where you come in.”

“What?” I exclaim.

“Calm down, I assure you it has been tested with human subjects before. Coma patients with zero chance of survival, mostly, and the body takes to the procedure quite well. You are in no danger.” Images flash across the screen, showing mice and other animals through this apparent procedure. Each develops a grotesque-looking version of a fish tail, many mutilated beyond belief. When he gets to the human attempts, I watch, dumfounded, as three coma patients are put through the procedure. The images flash by rapidly, showing the change over time. The tails… there’s no doubt in my mind that they are real. And that’s what frightens me.

I wet my lips. “Why? Why do you want to make me… that,” I ask in a shaky voice as I try desperately not to panic. Keep him talking; give myself time to think.

“Did I not make that clear?” He inquires. “Or is it that it is clear to you and we are about to start the ‘why me’ stage of this conversation where you tell me I’ll never get away with it, like I’m a villain in a film, and then dissolve into begging and pleading once you realize that I will?”

“What makes you think you will?” I demand, knowing I’m likely to regret asking. “Sophie will notice I’m missing.”

“Several reasons. Firstly, we are by over six world leaders and governments, I don’t have to worry about cops knocking at our door. Secondly, we were very thorough. Yesterday afternoon, two men in uniform showed up at the marine park your Sophie runs. They told her the news.” He holds up a photo of a covered corpse, strands of brown-blonde hair sticking out, as well as a single lock of purple; the same shade as the one in my hair. “About the hit and run accident. Drunk driver. How her beloved adoptive daughter was hit, didn’t survive. They offered her the comfort that you died quickly. Dentals and medical records of some bone restructuring after a nasty break confirmed the identity. Katherine Waters is dead. It also helps that I chose a subject who resided on the opposite side of the world. Australia is lovely, but welcome to the United States, Miss Waters.” He leans in close. “And the final reason, just in case that wasn’t enough; within the next twelve hours, the effects will not only be irreversible, but also to a point where, even if we were interrupted and you were magically saved, you would want to continue.” He shows me another photo of a women with malformed legs, only fused from the ankles down, with her feet cardboard thin and elongated, the skin twisted and warped. “This is the state of the transformation after twelve hours. The procedure takes roughly sixty hours to complete. “By this point, would you want us to finish what we started?”

I turn away and squeeze my eyes shut against the tears that begin to roll down my cheeks. “So that’s it then? No way out?”

“No,” he replies curtly. “Though I will admit, you are holding up better than I thought you would. You are not going to start begging now are you?”

“I don’t see the point,” I answer, swallowing the lump in my throat. “Unless there is a way for me to stop it?”

“Again, no. So if that’s that, we might as well get started.” He pulls a small trolley over. It’s filled with medical supplies.

“Wait!” I beg, my resolve slipping. He arches an eyebrow. “Will you walk me through it? Before you start will you tell me what’s going to happen? Please?”

The man sighs and runs his hand over the bare skin of his head. “I suppose.” He brings more images up onto the screen. “It will start with your feet. The bones will dissolve and they will merge and stretch out, but it isn’t until later that they actually begin to take the shape of the fin. Your eyes will develop a watery over layer, barely noticeable unless you look closely; it will help you see clearly underwater. The jaw is next. It will shift to accommodate the new sizing of your teeth, which will get stronger. The eyeteeth will sharpen into powerful fangs that will actually return to a normal state. We have yet to determine if this is at will, fueled by emotion, or a reflex like a cat’s claws,” he begins. “You will develop gills here,” he touches the side of my neck just behind my jawbone below my ear.

“So I won’t be able to surface again?” I ask.

“No, no. It is just as unusual as the fangs; the gills fade away when not in use. They will merge with your skin when you’re above the water. Our specimen has a fully functional set of lungs, so you will be able to breathe freely in both environments. You will of course grow scales on the tail once it has fully formed, but also on your chest as well. By this point your fin will have taken shape and become functional, so the scales are the final transition.”

“Sixty hours?”

“Yes. You will be awake during the transition. Well, not the whole thing, you will sleep, but I am only going to sedate you in the beginning to make applying IV’s and such, faster, easier, and a little more comfortable for you. While you’re awake, you will be fully provided for, your body kept healthy and hydrated. I doubt you’ll care much for entertainment. Before we begin, do you have any allergies or sensitivities, especially to chemicals? I suggest you speak up because it will determine whether or not you survive.”

“I don’t think so. I’ve never been tested or anything, but I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything either.”

“Hmm, we’ll keep a monitor on your systems then.”

“Does it hurt?” The question slips out. I can’t stop this.

“We won’t know for sure, after all the only human subjects have had little brain activity, but from scans we have learned that there is discomfort for most of it, perhaps twinges. As far as we know the only significantly painful part will be when your legs merge. This is probably because it is the most intense part as well. The pain isn’t enough to kill you though, if that’s what you’re worried about.”

“What happens after?”

“You adjust. Like I said, Katherine Waters is dead, and once your transformation is complete, you’ll no longer be human. I don’t know how it will affect your mind or your ability to speak, but it won’t matter because you won’t need to.”

“So in other words you plan to make me like an animal at the zoo? I don’t get it, why not just hire somebody for this? I’m sure you’d get plenty of volunteers and it would be less of a hassle.”

“Actually it would be more of one. Hiring someone means contracts, and payouts, and lawyers, and restrictions and conditions, really this is easier. This way, all I have to deal with is making a person disappear. That’s done and now I can do what I want with you.” He pats my head. “But don’t worry too much; we’ll take good care of you. Really, I don’t see the issue. You’ll have free food and accommodations, a unique new body, full medical care, and you’ll never have to go to school or work. You can live a laid-back life. We don’t need to use you for experiments beyond some basic observations and scans. The only thing we’ll expect from you is to behave. Put on a pretty smile for the crowds when we open the attraction.”

“Well I don’t want it. I just want to go home to Sophie,” my voice cracks a little.

“You don’t get a choice in the matter, remember? Now enough chatter, it’s high time we got started.” He drapes a hospital style gown across my chest. “Now I’m going to let you up. You’re going to put that on and we are going to go down the hall and get you prepped. I’ve been kind enough to ensure that you’ll be prepped by women, since you will lose that robe very soon. You aren’t going to give me a hard time or you’ll seriously regret the punishments that will come with it. I have zero tolerance, you understand?”

“Yes,” I sniff. I hate showing him weakness, but I can’t stop the tears that fall from the corners of my eyes. He unlatches the cuffs holding me down and moves to face the door. I sit up and slip the hospital gown over my head. It falls to my knees, but does little to keep me warm. I walk over to him, my eyes scanning for a way out.

“Don’t bother. We are fourteen floors underground. The elevator’s lowest level is two floors above us. Every guard in the facility knows your face as is on the lookout for you. Each stairwell is heavily guarded. All the guards are carrying Tasers and stun-guns, designed to painfully subdue, but not kill. Then you’ll have to deal with punishment after that.”

“I get it,” I retort. “No escaping.”

“I don’t care much for sarcasm, Miss Waters,” He retorts before he opens the door and presses a hand into the small of my back, forcing me forward. The halls are all the same, white cement lit by caged bulbs in the ceiling. He leads me to the end of one such hall and pushes me into the room. It looks like a typical doctor’s office. A sink and many cupboards line the one wall, an examination bed is against another, and there’s a door leading to a smaller room off to the side. It lacks typical medical posters and such though. Two women are waiting inside. One older, her shoulder length hair is fully grey and her calculating brown eyes scare me. The other woman is much younger. She looks to be in her early twenties. Her black hair is pulled into a simple ponytail. She looks friendlier, but I know she won’t help me. Probably can’t.

“You know what to do?” The man behind me asks.

“Of course, now leave her and let us do our job,” the older woman retorts. There’s a grunt in response before the man departs. “Take her.”

The other woman steps forward and grabs my upper arm. Her grip is firm, but gentle. “Come on,” she says as she leads me to the side room. It’s a small barren bathroom. A toilet, a roll of toilet paper on a hook, a small metal sink, and a showerhead with a drain in the far corner. I glance at the woman expectantly. She nods towards the toilet. “They don’t want anything in your systems before they begin, so unless you want a catheter, I suggest you go now.” I blush slightly.

“What about-”

“You’ll be getting an enema in a few minutes.”

“Oh.”

“I have to go prepare that. I trust you’ll be okay in here?” I nod. She leaves the room and I turn and glance over the room. Fear grips my heart and I pinch myself, just in case it’s a dream. No such luck. I feel my lip quiver and I bite it, hard. I swallow the lump in my throat and fight back tears; crying won’t help me. I may not be able to stop this, but I’m not going to make it worse on myself. Lie low and wait for an opportunity. It’s the only plan I’ve got.

I’m tying the sash closed on my gown when the woman walks back in. She sets a small bottle on the counter and I hesitate at the nozzle on it. I’ve had an enema before, once, when I was younger and I know it’s not pleasant.

“Don’t bother with the sash,” the woman says. “You have to take it off now anyways.”

“Do I have to?” I ask, my voice cracking.

She nods as she unrolls a towel on the floor. “Yes. Come on.” She reaches for me and I take a step back, hugging my shoulders. “You might as well get it done and over with,” she advises. “Stalling won’t help you, you know that.” A sob escapes me and I move further away from her. She stands up and pulls me against her. “Hush now, I know. I know you’re scared, but keeping them waiting won’t help you any. I wish I could help you, this is wrong, but we’re both stuck.”

“I don’t want to do this,” I whisper.

“I know.” She pulls me over to the towel. Her fingers pull open the sash and I don’t fight as she opens the gown and lets it fall to the floor. “I need you to lie down on your side.” I take a deep breath and wipe my nose on my arm before I sit down on the towel. Another deep breath and I stretch out on my side. “Curl up, okay? Your knees need to touch your chest.”

I slowly comply with her request. I hear the snap of thin plastic gloves as she pulls them on; feel them as she touches my thigh. I flinch and try to pull away. “Please, don’t.”

“Relax, it’s going to be okay. Have you ever had one of these before?”

“Once. I was younger though. It hurt.”

“I know, this one is a little different though. It’s far more powerful. The cramps will hurt more, but it will work much faster and the pain will fade more quickly.” I feel the tip of the nozzle against my skin and panic.

“No, wait, please!”

“I can’t sweetie, but let’s talk. Keep your mind off it. What’s your name?”

“Katie,” I whisper, wincing. “But I suppose that doesn’t matter. They’ll probably call me something different now, if they call me anything at all, right?”

“Yes, they are giving you a new name, but I figured you might want someone to know your real one. I don’t want to hurt you, Katie. I wish things were different. It might not mean much, but I put in a request to be one of your handlers. That way you’ll have someone who still looks at you as a person. The tail shouldn’t change that. I doubt my chances are high, but I tried.”

“Thank you,” I whisper. “You said they were giving me a new name. Do you know what it is?”

“Not for certain, but I know they were debating between Aqua and Bailey, but they could have picked another.”

“Hopefully Bailey, Aqua sounds stupid.”

“Yeah, I suppose it does,” she agrees. My stomach make a strange growling noise and I feel it begin to cramp up. “You raising a bear or something?” The woman teases. I let out a small laugh, but it ends in a sob.

“Not that I know of.”

She rubs my back gently. “It’s going to be okay.”

I wince as the older woman jabs another needle into my arm. This is the fifth one and my arm is starting to bruise. She hasn’t spoken a word to me, or even met my gaze, just gone about her task quickly, as though I can’t actually feel the needles she’s practically ramming into my arm. I know this is likely how I’m going to be treated for the rest of my life and the knowledge makes my heart clench.

“There,” the woman states as she sets down the empty syringe. She moves away and comes back with a glass. She shoves it into my hands and barks out a single word command. “Drink.”

The liquid is thick and yellow, and has a horribly pungent odor. “What is this?” I ask.

Jenny, the younger woman, answers me, “it’s to make you throw up,” she explains. “In case there was anything in your stomach, but I don’t see the point since you haven’t eaten in the past twenty-four hours at least. Just drink it okay?”

I nod, take a deep breath, and tip back the glass. The liquid tastes just a foul as it smells and I gag on it, but manage to choke down a few mouthfuls. Jenny takes the glass from me and offers me an encouraging smile. Then she hands me a tin bucket. I wait a few seconds but nothing happens. “Are you sure this stuff-” I break off as my stomach lurches. Suddenly the liquid is coming back up along with a fair amount of bile.

Jenny peels my hair away from my face. “Yes, I’m sure that it works.”

I groan as my stomach flips again. There’s nothing left to come up though, and I spend the next couple of minutes dry heaving. When my stomach finally settles I wipe the corner of my mouth, my chest heaving. Jenny takes the bucket from me and hands me back the hospital gown. I put it back on, grateful to be covered up. She pulls me to my feet.

“Come on,” she says. “It’s almost time.” My stomach begins to twist itself into a huge knot inside of me as she leads me down the hall. She pulls open the door to a stairwell, nodding at the guard seated there, and ushers me up. We go down another hall, up another flight of stairs, and into the elevator.

“Where are we going?” I ask.

“Ground level three,” she replies. “The operation room has been prepared for you.”

“You aren’t actually going to cut me open or anything right?” I ask in a pleading tone.

“No, the procedure doesn’t require surgery and I don’t think they plan on opening you up later. You’re forgetting that you’re going to be specimen number two. And they’ve had number one to play with for six years. I think they’ve learned all they are going to about the insides.”

The elevator door slides open and Jenny continues walking. I hurry to follow her, not wanting to be caught alone after the warning I received earlier. This area is much, much busier, with scientists and others bustling about. The walls are still white, but are tiled and there’s a large window allowing sunlight to spill into the massive floor. I pause briefly, wondering if I’ll ever see outside again.

We pass a huge tank as we walk. A brief glance over the rail tells me it reaches the main ground floor and extends up at least another two floors. The crystalline water is abundant with small reef fish, swaying kelp, and colorful coral. I stare through the glass, glancing around to see if I can catch sight of the merperson. Jenny puts her hand on my shoulder, startling me. “She’s not in there. They can’t have her in a public tank remember? Not by herself,” she gives me a tug and we resume walking. “You know, that’s the only descent thing about this whole situation. At least she won’t be alone anymore.”

“What is she like?” I inquire, suddenly curious about the creature who is likely my new roommate for the rest of my life.

“I’ve never actually met her, not personally anyways, I’ve seen her being transferred around, occasionally caught a glimpse walking by a room, but she’s kept in a restricted part of the building. I don’t have clearance.”

“Oh.”

Jenny leads me through a set of double doors into a wide room. It has small plastic chairs and leads off into three separate rooms, all with closed steel doors. I know instantly that I’m wanted inside one of those rooms. Terror floods my senses and I take a few steps backwards and shake my head. “No,” I whisper. “No, I can’t do this. I have to-” I don’t bother finishing as I turn and try to bolt back through the door. Jenny grabs my arms, pulls me back, and hugs me to her tightly.

“Calm down,” she orders.

“No, let go, please I cannot do this,” I beg, a sob leaving my throat. “Don’t take me in there; please don’t let them do this.”

Jenny rubs my back. “Get your head back, Katie. Relax; it’s going to be okay. You can’t stop it; you know that. Don’t make it harder on yourself. I don’t want to restrain you. Please don’t force it to come to that. Take a minute, okay? Relax, breathe, and then we’ll go in there. They aren’t going to jump you the second you walk in, so relax.”

Easier said than done, still, I know I can’t win this fight and that Jenny is right, I need to relax. I take a couple of deep breaths and slump against her. “I’m scared, I don’t want to do this.”

“I know, sweetheart, and believe me; if it were up to me, I would walk you to the front door and turn the other way, but I can’t. Do you think you’re okay enough to go inside now?”

I hesitate, but nod and allow her to lead me to the middle door. She swipes a card and a small light flashes green. She opens the door and brings me inside. The room is small and has a conjoining door off to the side of a giant mirror. One-way glass. So they can watch. I swallow the lump in my throat. The guy from earlier is in the room, along with a man who looks more like an assistant.

“She’s all ready to go?” The scientist asks. Jenny nods.

“Go sit down,” she tells me, nodding to the hospital bed. The metal rail that runs around it is already equipped with restraints. I shudder, but take a seat on the edge of the mattress.

“Good, let’s get started then.”

“Wait,” Jenny says. “Look, I know this might be a little out of line, but-” she pauses. “She has been very good about all of this. Far better than we could expect anyone to hold up, given the circumstances, especially someone so young. She hasn’t thrown any fits, tried to bolt, or given us a hard time. Mild hesitation, yes, but nothing more. I don’t think that should go unrewarded. Just as bad behavior shouldn’t go unpunished.”

“I suppose you’re right. What are you suggesting?”

Jenny turns to me. “If you could ask for anything right now, other than to be let go, what would it be?”

“To say goodbye,” I whisper. “To Sophie. If I’m never going to see her again, can I at least call her? Say goodbye?”

“That would be impossible, considering you’re dead, remember?” The scientist states. “Pick something else. Perhaps you’d like to be sedated the whole process, or given some form of entertainment?”

“You mentioned that I’m supposed to have caretakers or something?”

“Handlers,” he corrects.

“Right, handlers. Can Jenny be one of them? Please?” I beg. I meet her gaze. “Stay with me?”

“I don’t tend to make staff changes par request like this,” the scientist mutters.

“Please? I promise, I won’t cause trouble,” I beg. I want this. I want to be around someone who will see me as an individual, as a person.

The man sighs. “It would be up to you, Miss Barnes. The hours are much longer than your current position, far more taxing, and you’d have to be on call at any hour. Despite all that, the pay upgrade significantly more and you’ll have the opportunity to move up.”

“Yeah, I’ll do it,” Jenny says.

“Then we’ll see about getting you training. Leave for now. I would actually like to get started now.” Jenny nods and meets my gaze briefly before she heads outside. “Remove that gown.” I’m ordered. I blush but slip out of it nonetheless. I promised not to be difficult and I don’t want to cross this man. “Now lie down.” My head has barely hit the small pillow when the assistant has my wrists pulled into the restraints, locking me down. My legs are left free, but I suppose they have to be. A tear slides down my cheek. This is it. I’m about to lose everything in the eyes of these people and become a simply animal. A money grab. And a freak of nature. The scientist approaches with a needle. He says nothing to me as he shoves it into my arm.

Black spots dance in my vision as he moves away. I fight to remain conscious for a few minutes before I lose and slip into a forced sleep.

## Kapitel 2:
I wake with a start and try to sit upright, but can’t; I’m still restrained. Not a dream then. The first thing I notice is the tubes up my nose. They’re irritating and slightly painful; not to mention that they hinder my breathing. There a tubes in my arms too. Five of them; three on one arm, two on the other. They’re taped down and are feeding different IV fluids into my body. I shudder at the different hanging bags. One has a transparent blue colored liquid, three of contain clear liquid, and the final one has a thick red liquid in it. It doesn’t take me long to figure out what it is and I instantly feel sorry for the donner. That’s a lot of blood.

I glance to my left to see Jenny sitting in a plastic chair that’s pushed against the wall with the panel of one-way glass. Her legs are curled up on the chair and her nose is in a book. I can’t see the title. “Jenny?” I manage to whisper her name. My throat is insanely dry and it’s making my voice raspy.

She glances up and offers me a small smile. She gets up, walks over, and brushes some hair off my face. “Hey,” she greets, her voice soft. “How are you feeling?”

“Groggy. Like I’ve been turned inside out,” I mutter.

“Sorry sweetie.”

“How long was I asleep?”

“About twelve hours,” she replies. “You’ve done pretty well so far.”

“It’s started then?” I instantly regret asking.

“Yeah. Definitely.”

“I’m afraid to move my legs,” I whisper. “Are they still, you know, legs?”

“Yes. They’ll be last to change; second to last part of the procedure.”

“Am I going to regret asking what is changed? Like, what it looks like?”

“Do you want to know?”

“I don’t know, yes, no…yes.”

Jenny laughs a little. “Look at me and open your eyes as wide as you can.” I frown but comply and she stares intently at my eyes. “It’s barely noticeable, but really kind of cool,” she comments.

“What?”

“Your eyes. I’ve been grilled on all the changes and on mermaid physiology over the past couple of hours. Your eyes have a bit of a glassy shine to them now. It’s supposed to allow you to see clearly underwater, and you have to look closely to really notice it, but at first glance, they do look a little…glossy? Do I look blurry to you?”

“What? No, why?”

“Just curious. It’s supposed to help you see underwater, I was wondering if it hindered your sight above it.”

“No, I can see you just fine.” I say.  “So what’s in all of those?” I motion with a finger towards one of the IV bags.

Jenny touches the red one. “Blood. The blueish one is a chemical that is neutralizing your nervous system and immune system so you don’t reject the change or any of the chemicals. Two of the clear bags are a mixture of chemicals that are infused with the DNA, the third is just nutrients to keep your body going.”

“And the tubes? Can they come out? They hurt and they aren’t helping me breathe.”

“They’re not for breathing. Those are going down into your lungs. It is set on a timer to release a gaseous form of whatever the cocktail is that they’re pumping into you. That way it’s absorbed directly into your cells.”

“Oh.”

I jump when the door suddenly opens and a man walks in. He’s carrying a tray of five syringes and his cold calculating gaze fixes on me, sizing me up.

“Can I help you?” Jenny asks.

“I am to administer these to the subject,” the man says. His voice is heavily accented, though I can’t identify its origin. “You were informed of this, yes?”

“Of course, I’m sorry, I lost track time and thought you were coming later.” Jenny removes the restraint from my wrist and slides a hand underneath me. “Roll over,” she tells me as she twists my body onto my side, so that I’m facing away from them. My feet feel thin as they flop over and I know they probably barely resemble feet. Jenny pushes my head down against the bed. “Straighten out and stay very still,” she commands. I obey, startled by her tone. The man snaps his gloves as he puts them on. I wonder if he did in on purpose to make me nervous. It works. He begins to poke and prod along my spine.

“What are you doing?” I twist to try and see.

Jenny pushes my head back down. “Stay still,” she repeats. “It’ll be okay.” The man pokes around at the bottom of my spine and I try to remain still. I’m given no warning when he sticks the needle into the base of my tailbone. The pain is intense and I stiffen, a whimper escaping me. The pressure grows unbearable before he finally removes the needle. I try to roll back over, but Jenny holds me still. “You’re not done yet.” The man’s gloved finger returns. He presses into the small of my back and has barely moved his hand when the needle goes in. I gasp at the sudden sharp pain. I can feel the bruise forming as he withdraws the syringe. Another is injected into the middle of my spine, the fourth between my shoulder blades.

“One more,” Jenny says. “Stay perfectly still okay?” I chew my lip and remain silent. There’s no finger first to give me warning to the needle and when the sharp point slides into my spine, at the base of my neck, I can’t help but cry out. My teeth slice through my lip as I bite it against the painful pressure in my neck. It feels like forever, though in reality it was probably only a couple of seconds, before the needle is removed from my skin. Footsteps and the sound of the door shutting signal the man’s departure.

Jenny carefully rolls me back over and restrains my wrist once more. She pulls her chair over and sits down. “You alright?”

I chew my lip again and fight back tears. All of this is getting to be too much and I just want to curl up in a fetal position and sob until it all goes away. “What was that stuff?”

“Spinal fluid,” Jenny answers. She brushes more hair off my face. “I’m sorry, I should have warned you beforehand.”

“I’m not going to have to do that again am I?”

“Yes, once more, forty-eight hours in, but I don’t think there will be as many needles next time.”

“I’ve always hated needles,” I whisper. “I want to go home.”

Jenny hesitates. “Why don’t you get some sleep?” She suggests. “You’re going to need it.” She doesn’t wait for a reply as she stands and leaves the room, turning the light off as she does. I rest my head against my shoulder, unable to do much else, and try to drift off to sleep.

***

I awaken with jaw pains. My entire lower jaw aches as though I’ve bashed it off a rock or something. I open my mouth and move my jaw around, trying to relieve the pressure. There’s a loud pop and one side of my jaw slumps sideways. I shriek, but more from fear than pain. What’s going on? More than anything I wish I could see my jaw right now, or at least reach up and feel around to try and figure out what’s going on. A thread of saliva trails down the side of my chin.  I try to lick it away and scrape my tongue against my tooth, a very sharp tooth. There’s another pop and my lower jaw becomes dislocated entirely. Incapable of closing my mouth, I close my eyes instead. Now that it’s hanging free and fully dislocated, the pain in my jaw grows. My gums are aching too.

I turn to face the mirror, hoping someone is watching on the other side. “At is appeing?” I lisp.

It takes a few seconds for the door to open and a boy who looks to be about eighteen or nineteen walks out. I’m thankful for the thin sheet covering my body. He grabs a metal cookie tray and sets it on the bed before leaning over me to release my one arm from its restraints. Keeping a firm grip on my wrist, he drags my arm over and ties it off next to my other arm. The position is uncomfortable on my shoulder and I roll onto my side. I’m assuming that’s what he wanted. He slides one hand under my head and lifts, sliding the tray underneath and releasing my head. With my jaw the way it is, I’m unable to stop the drool leaking from my mouth. It begins to pool on the tray and I realize its purpose and am instantly offended. The boy turns without a word and walks back to the door.

“Hey!” I shout, the word garbled. “On’t eave ee like his!”

The boy pauses for a moment in the doorframe. “Shut up!” He snaps with a shake of his head. “Stupid fish.” Then he slams the door behind him.

My heart clenches. I’m barely into this transformation and I’m already being treated like a mindless beast. A stray tear slips down my cheek. I want to go home. Sophie, please come save me.

I lie there, in a pool of my own saliva, for who knows how long. The pain has dulled and now everything has gone numb.  I look up when the door opens and Jenny steps in. “Good morning sweetie, how are you-” she breaks off when she gets a good look at me. “Hey, who did this?”

“Oiy,” I attempt, pointing at the mirror. “Ease elp.”

“Okay, we’ll fix this; just hang on okay?” She disappears into the room behind the mirror. When she comes back out, she’s carrying a towel and what looks like a mouth guard. She takes the tray out from under me, replaces it with the towel, and dumps it in the sink. Then she comes back and opens my mouth further. “I just want to take a look, okay? Wow, those came in nicely. Now I need you to try and bite down on this as hard as you can, alright?” She sticks the mouth guard between my teeth. It takes effort to close my jaw, but I manage to close my mouth around the guard. There’s sickening crack and slight pain as my jaw pops back into place.

“Ow, jeez, that was unpleasant,” I say, my words still slightly garbled.

“Can you close your mouth fully?” Jenny asks. I nod and comply.

“It feels a little weird though,” I state as I adjust to the strange feeling in my jaw. At least my speech has improved. “What happened?”

“Your fangs came in,” Jenny says. “That’s why your jaw was dislocated, so it could adjust to the new sizing of your teeth.”

“Really? I have fangs?” I open my mouth and try to feel them with my tongue. “It doesn’t feel like it.”

“No, they’ve faded right now. Here, snarl at me.”

“Snarl?”

“Bare your teeth, like a dog would.”

I shrug, but curl my upper lip and try to look menacing. “Are they there?”

“No. But they were a few seconds ago, when your jaw was still dislocated. I wonder what made them fade.” I frown and try really hard. I think fangs would look kind of cool. They might not be so bad to have. I focus on my teeth. Please form. Suddenly my lower lip is poked painfully.

“Ow.” I open my mouth a little. “That hurt.”

“They look pretty cool,” Jenny comments. “Creepy, but cool.”

I nod, then shift uncomfortably on the bed. “I don’t suppose you would be allowed to let me out of these cuffs for a few minutes, would you? I really need to stretch.”

Jenny’s face falls. “I'm not supposed to remove the restraints unless you need to be rolled over or something, in which case I’m supposed to only remove one at a time and maintain total control over your free arm.”

“Oh,” I respond. “Could you at least move the restraints further down so I can sit up? These bars won’t let me slide them down the length of the bed to do it myself.”

“Yeah, that I can probably do,” she agrees. She removes the restraints, one at a time, and clips them behind the second bar of the bed, allowing me room to sit up, but she’d have to move them back again for me to lie down. I purposely keep my gaze away from my body, unwilling to see what thin mass of flesh is left of my feet.

There’s a sudden beeping noise, followed by a hissing sound. The tubes in my noise rattle slightly and then I'm choking, coughing uncontrollably as I attempt to pull oxygen into my lung with no success.

Jenny grabs my arms. “Relax, it’ll be over in a couple seconds and you’ll be able to breathe again.” She’s right. The hissing noise stops and seconds later, I’m inhaling properly. I gasp in the process. “That’s the first time that’s happened while you’ve been awake, isn’t it?”

I nod. “Yes. How often does it happen?”

“Every three hours, on the hour,” Jenny replies. “I guess you could keep time with it. It’s eleven a.m. right now.”

“Eleven,” I whisper. “I wonder what time it is back home. I wonder what Sophie’s doing right now.”

“Mourning probably,” Jenny states. Her face suddenly goes ashen. “Oh my goodness, sweetie; I am so sorry, I didn’t even think.”

I can’t help but sniffle at the thought. I can’t imagine how Sophie must feel. I hope she doesn’t blame herself. There’s no reason for it, but knowing her; she’d find some way to twist it and pin the blame on herself. “It’s okay,” I mumble. “I guess I just really miss her.”

“She’s your mother right?”

“Yes.”

“What happened to your birth parents? If it’s not too personal to ask.”

“My father died when I was young,” I say. “My mother and Sophie used to be friends back in high school, but they had some sort of falling out around the time I was born. I don’t know what it was. It was always my father who would take me to visit, but when he died...” I trail off, feeling my throat close a little at the tough subject. “I remember being woken in the middle of the night and Roxanne driving me down to the marine park. She told me she’d follow me in, sent me ahead, and then took off. Sophie didn’t tell me when it happened because she didn’t want me to feel abandoned or unwanted, but Roxanne had transferred parental rights to her. I haven’t seen Roxanne since, but I don’t really want to. I love Sophie. She wanted me. Even when my own mother didn’t.”

“I’m sorry,” Jenny says.

“I just keep thinking about her now. Sophie’s parents passed away before I was born and she was the only child of two only children. She has no living relatives and isn’t able to have kids. She loved me and now she’s going to be all by herself. And it’s my fault.”

“Honey, it’s not your fault,” Jenny says.

“I shouldn’t have gone. I should never have agreed to go on that excursion. It was a setup wasn’t it?”

“Yes,” Jenny admits.

I nod. “I knew. Deep down, something wasn’t right. There should have been more planning. And you don’t hire a teenaged photographer and want an excursion, you hire a photographer to take photos. There should have been a dive master. I shouldn’t have gone, but I wanted the money. Sophie’s birthday is in two weeks and had my eye on something nice.”

“What was it?” Jenny inquires.

“It was a necklace,” I answer. “A simple gold chain with a locket on it. There was a little dolphin hanging from the locket, Sophie loves dolphins. I was going to put a picture of the two of us inside it and get it engraved to say ‘the family I chose to love’. It’s what she always told me I was; the family she chose to love rather than the family she was born with.” More tears run down my cheeks. “I wanted her to know that’s what she is to me. Instead, the only thing she’ll get for her birthday is a ‘dead’ daughter, the last of her family. And it’s my fault.”

Jenny squeezes my knee. “I’m really sorry. This shouldn’t have happened. If they wanted a subject, they should have hired someone, or picked up an orphan off the street and given them the choice, at least this would be a better life than one on the streets. They should have picked someone who had something to gain, not someone who had everything to lose.”

“Part of me is glad it’s me because it means that someone else doesn’t have to suffer. And it might not be so bad if things were different. If I could still see Sophie and everyone here didn’t look at me like a mindless beast and treat me like one too.” I stare at my hands. “If things were different, I may have even agreed to it.” I reach my hand down and pull against the restraints to try to scratch an itch on my knee. I have really to wiggle around in the cuff to get it to slide a little further up my arm so that I can reach. “These things are a pain.”

“They’ll come off when you’re done changing, hang in there.”

“How far in am I? That scientist said it took sixty hours. How long have I been going through this?”

“Close to thirty-four hours now,” Jenny replies. “I’ve been warned that the more drastic changes should be starting any time now.”

“What’s next?” I ask. The scientist said the tail was last, that I would grow scales on my chest and gills first.

“Gills,” Jenny says. “Though they don’t normally open, so you can’t tell, but the brain activity scans did pick up discomfort around now. Actually, the gills are the first change that showed up as a discomfort, and the only thing that read actual pain was the tail, but it shouldn’t be too bad.”

“I hope not,” I whisper. I let my head fall backwards so I can stare at the ceiling. “Call me childish, but I’m so bored. There’s not much I can do but lie here and listen to the beeping of these machines when you’re not here, and talk to you when you are about things I want to forget about. And sleep, I can sleep, but I need help to sit up and lie down on my own. You could leave right now for the day and I’d be screwed. The only way anyone else here is going to bother letting me lie down is if the need me to in order for them to jab me with something or something.”

Jenny nods. “Maybe I’ll ask if I can bring a deck of cards in here or something tomorrow and maybe leave them with you so you can at least play solitaire.”

I raise an eyebrow and wave my hands a little. “Uh, I appreciate the offer, but how am I supposed to play anything like this?”

“That’s why I’d ask, see if you can be released for a bit, or at least have restraints with ties so they’re longer and give you a little free range with your hands,” Jenny explains. A little timer on her watch goes off and she glances at it.

“What’s that mean?” I ask.

“It’s my lunch break. I promised my son that I’d drive him to a friend’s house when I took my break. Will you be okay here on your own?”

I nod. “I’ll probably try and take a nap.”

“Alright.” Jenny adjusts my restraints so that I can lie down, bids me goodbye, and leaves me alone in the room. With the beeping machines. Beep. One, two, three. Beep. I sigh.

## Kapitel 3:
I don’t end up taking my nap. Not long after Jenny leaves, I begin to feel that discomfort she was talking about and it isn’t pleasant. It begins with an itch. I twist my neck and my wrist as best I can, but I’m unable to scratch it. I fall back in the bed, defeated, and attempt to ignore the itch in hopes that it will fade. It doesn’t. It begins to grow worse and then it starts to sting like lemon juice in a cut. I wince. As my neck continues to throb, there’s a burning sensation that starts up in my chest. At first it’s just little. Some tightness. However, that changes very quickly and suddenly it feels on fire. I can’t help but cry out. The burning sensation grows, flames licking their way up my windpipe. I cough. It doesn’t help that at that moment there’s a loud tone and a hissing noise, signaling the return of the gas. I can feel it rattling the nasal tubes and then I can’t breathe again. It takes thirty seconds for the gas to subside. As if it has an instant affect the burning gets worse. A wail escapes me. I would do anything for a glass of water or something cold right now. Anything to ease the blaze.

Sweat beads on my brow and it becomes hard to breathe. I grip the rail of the bed tightly, squeeze my eyes shut, and try to wait it out. This has to be the ‘discomfort’ of my gills forming. If this is discomfort, I’m terrified for the tail.

The pain is still here when Jenny returns and by this point, I'm gasping for breath. I feel like a fish pulled from the water.

“I feel like every time I leave you alone, I return to you in pain and in need of help,” Jenny sighs. “What’s the matter?”

“Water,” I wheeze. “Please, it burns.”

“I can’t give you water, sweetheart, you’re not allowed to have anything in your system until this is over. What hurts?”

“My throat and… and my chest. Hard to breathe.”

“Okay, hang in there,” Jenny says. She hurries to the sink and fills a glass with water. I watch as she brings it over. She presses the cool glass against the skin of my neck. Wetting her fingers, she rubs the liquid against my throat. While it feels nice on my dry skin, it doesn’t help take the pain away. Tears roll down my cheeks as I wonder about how long it will last. A door slamming against the wall makes me jump. The boy from earlier comes back in and drops something on the chair Jenny was using earlier. It hits with a dull thud. It looks like a short, clear, water-filled lifejacket. It’s frozen solid.

“I was told to give this to you when the gills started coming in,” the boy says to Jenny. “You’re here now, so here. It’s apparently supposed to help shock the lungs into widening to make breathing easier.”

“How long has she been like this?”

The boy shrugs. “Forty-five minutes? I don’t know.”

“And you’re only bringing this out now!” Jenny demands. “You couldn’t have helped her?”

“Hey, babysitting the fish is your job, I'm just supposed to keep an eye on the monitors and the room, and report any changes.” He stuffs his hands in his pockets and walks away. A muscle feathers in Jenny’s jaw, showing her displeasure.

“Jerk,” I mutter. Jenny doesn’t speak; instead she releases both my restraints and pulls me upright. She keeps a hand on one of my arms.

“Arms out,” she requests. I blush slightly at her request. I really wish I had been allowed to keep the gown. The sheet works fine when I’m lying down, but now… I sigh and put my arms out. Jenny slides the jacket on and buckles it up. It barely reaches the bottom of my ribcage, and I gasp at the sudden cold. The boy was right; it does make it a little easier to breathe, though the pain is still present. “Better?”

I nod. “Yeah, a little. Thanks.”

“Let me see your neck,” she requests. She gently pushes on my head and I tilt it to the side.

“Can you see anything?” I ask.

“The area is really red, but I don’t actually see gills. The only way to find out if they’ve formed is for you to be underwater. You could stick your head in a bucket,” she suggests. I shake my head. “Why not?”

I wring my hands. “I don’t want to know,” I whisper. “The fangs are one thing, you could have easily just filed my teeth, and my feet could very well just be tightly bound in a big sock or something. As long as I don’t look, it’s possible in my mind. But gills, breathing underwater,” I hesitate. “That makes it real and I'm just…not ready yet.” I hang my head, my hair falling into my face. Jenny squeezes my shoulder.

“I understand that it’s hard, but what are you going to do tomorrow when the transformation completes? You’re going to have a-”

“I know,” I snap.

Jenny’s face falls. “I wasn’t trying to upset you, I-”

“I know. I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to snap. I guess I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed,” I admit.

“Do you want some time by yourself?”

I shake my head. “No, not really.” I shiver, suddenly very cold. The pain has subsided and now this frozen life jacket is really cold. I unclip the buckle and slide it off. I grab the sheet and tug it around my body instead.

“Feeling any better?”

“Yeah, a little. The pain is gone and I can breathe. Tomorrow is really…” I trail off.

“Yes. You’re forty hours in. At eleven tonight you’ll be woken up for your final injections.”

“You mean the ones they put in my back?” I wince as she nods her head. “That was really painful.”

“Don’t expect to get much sleep tonight,” Jenny says. “But I'm not leaving work tonight, so you won’t be on your own.”

“Thank you,” I sigh with relief. “It means a lot.”

“No one should go through something like this alone; besides, someone’s got to look after you.” She hesitates. “I hate to do this to you, but I have to put at least on restraint back on.” I sigh and nod. I press my left hand against the rail of the bed so she can strap it back down. “How do you feel now?”

“A lot better. It’s weird. It’s like there’s a lot of pain when it’s happening but then it fades almost instantly once whatever change is going on has been completed.”

“Well, that’s a good thing,” Jenny states. “Less pain, right?”

I nod. Our conversation is interrupted when the scientist walks in, along with two others. One is a girl who looks a little older than Jenny, her blonde hair pulled into a tight bun, and the other is the teenaged boy from before. The woman pushes a gurney into the room, the sight of it making me shudder. What now?

“Dr. Auldon, sir, is there something that you need?” Jenny asks.

“Yes,” The man replies. He nods to the woman. “Put her under and get her loaded up.”

The woman approaches me and preps a syringe. A sedative, I’d presume. She doesn’t bother making eye contact as she injects the needle’s contents into my arm. My restraints are removed and I'm forced to sit up. My limbs grow heavy and limp. My arms are forced into the sleeves of a robe. It’s Jenny that picks me up afterwards, but by this point, my vision is hazy. I think my head hits her shoulder, but I don’t know for sure.

***

The lights seem harsher and I squint while my eyes adjust.

“Hey,” Jenny greets. “Have a nice nap?”

“No,” I groan. “What did they want this time?”

“To alter your appearance. They didn’t want to risk someone recognizing you. Don’t worry, it’s nothing too extensive like surgical adjustments or anything. Here, sit up and I’ll show you,” Jenny offers. It’s then that I realize my hands aren’t tied to the bars of the bed. I sit up and instantly realize two differences. My hair is longer. It once fell to the bottom of my shoulder blades, but now it brushes the skin of my hips. The other difference is its color. What used to be a light, brownish-blonde, is now a dark oak color. My purple highlight is gone too.

“Oh,” I say. Jenny offers me a small hand mirror. I hesitate before taking it. My eyebrows have been dyed and plucked into slim lines. I’m surprised to find my eyes the same; I was expecting contacts or something to change the color. The freckles are new though. Three or four uneven rows of them outline the bottom of my eyes, thinning out to sprinkle across the top of my nose. While the overall effect doesn’t look bad, it also no longer resembles my face. Even someone who saw me every day would be hard-pressed to recognize me now.

“I'm sorry, sweetheart, but you have awful timing,” Jenny says.

“What do you mean?” I ask.

She glances at her watch. “In less than a minute they’re returning to give you those needles,” she breaks off in a yawn. “I was hoping you’d sleep right through, but clearly not. Though you did sleep through the growth of your chest scales, so that’s something,” she says.

“Really? Do they have a color?” I ask.

“No. Just a skin tone. It’s paler than your actual color, but you are very tan, so I’d imagine it was your skin tone when you were born. I’d suggest the same shade your skin returns to in the winter when you spend less time in the sun, but there isn’t much of a winter in Australia is there?”

“No, there isn't.” I jump at the sound of the door opening. I’m really starting to hate that sound because more often than not, something bad often follows. The man who did the needles last time has returned. Three syringes contain the same murky yellow liquid as before. Spinal fluid. I can’t imagine what it must feel like to have that extracted. I hope they put the mermaid to sleep when they do it, though part of me seriously doubts it. One detail about the needles sticks out.

“Those points are a lot longer than the last ones.”

Jenny squeezes my hand. “They go in a lot further,” she explains. “Now come on, lie down on your side, facing away from us.” I lie back and roll over, no point resisting. I hate the feeling of rolling my feet, which are fused together from the ankles down, and the tips flop about like paper.

The needle is inserted quickly, at the base of my spine, and the immediate and unbearable pain steals a scream from me. It didn’t hurt this bad last time. Grinding my teeth helps keep back a scream as the second one goes into the middle of my back, only a whimper escapes. The final needle is put into the base of my neck, and this one hurts the most. It also scares me. As he’s pushing it in, I can imagine the tip managing to protrude from my throat. It doesn’t, obviously, and it’s all over in a matter of seconds. Those seconds, however, are enough to leave me shaking.

“Roll onto your back,” Jenny requests. I shake my head, afraid to put my weight on my throbbing spine. “Yes, come on now.” She tugs on my arm, forcing me to obey. “Now bring your knees to your chest.” Again, she ‘assists’ in making sure I follow her command. I hug my knees, but manage to avoid looking at my feet.

“What are you doing?” I ask. My question goes unanswered. There’s a lot of rustling. Jenny scoops me up and lays me down on the floor. My hips down, hit something cold and wet.

“Stretch out now,” Jenny requests. I do and my legs touch the same cold gel like substance. The wax paper, or whatever the stuff is on, is wrapped tightly around my hips and legs down to my ankles. Then a blanket is pulled over top and everything is belted down with three different straps to hold it in place. I'm placed back on the bed and the man leaves.

“Jenny, what’s this for?” I ask again.

“It’s to keep your legs protected and hydrated. The needles trigger the tail. It should only be a couple of minutes before your legs start to merge. But because the tail will be very new, until the scales grow the exposed skin will be very weak. This stuff will help protect it because it will tear easily otherwise. It’s also to force your legs together to make the change a little faster. This is supposed to be the longest and most painful part of the change, so brace yourself.”

I swallow the painfully large lump forming in the back of my throat. “I don’t think I can do this.”

“You have to, there’s no turning back now. No stopping it.”

“I know. How long did you say that I had before it starts?”

Jenny glances at her watch again. “It could start any second now, but it might still take a few minutes.”

No sooner than the words leave her mouth, I feel it start. My legs go completely limp and numb, before an intense pins and needles sensation shoots through the appendages. I wince slightly, though if this is all I'm going to feel, I'll be really grateful. Something tells me this is only the beginning though.

“Are you alright?” Jenny asks.

A door opens. The door to the conjoining room behind the mirror. Dr. Auldon pokes his head out. “Miss Barnes,” he calls gruffly. “In here now!”

Jenny sighs and squeezes my hand. “Stay strong. Hopefully I can come back out once I find out what he wants,” she murmurs quietly. Then she turns and follows the scientist into the other room. He closes the door, leaving me alone. Well, not totally alone, I know they’re watching me; but on my own through this. I know he won’t let Jenny come back in. I resign myself to the next couple of, likely very painful, hours. The pins and needles sensation grows stronger, but it’s not totally unbearable and I start to relax a little. I can handle this. Then suddenly it’s like someone has stabbed a knife into both of my legs, just above the ankles and slices right up both my limbs. I scream. The feeling comes again, stretching the incision. I would believe it just a sensation, except for the warm liquid running down my legs. I’m bleeding. My legs are actually tearing open. And the pain is excruciating. I scream again as the burning comes. It feels like flames are licking their way up my legs, consuming them like dried timber. My hips buck as my body begins to convulse. Someone enters the room then. He holds me down while another man straps me down. My head, shoulders, arms, lower stomach, and my feet just below the ankles, are belted down by leather straps that render me incapable of almost any movement. I curl my fingers into tight fists and shriek. My pain falls on deaf ears as the two, with their task completed, leave me alone in the room once more.

***

I don’t know how long it goes on, feels like hours, but the pain continues to grow worse. I can’t, however much I want to, stop screaming. I’ve rubbed my throat raw and even started coughing up blood earlier. Being unable to sit up, I almost choked on the blood and had to swallow it before I did. I know I started pleading too, begging them to make it stop, but my pleas went ignored so I eventually gave up. I can’t really differentiate my legs anymore and I know they’ve become one limb. It makes me wonder why there’s still incredible pain, but I soon get my answer. The outside may have finished forming, but all new bones and muscles are growing inside, old ones melting away. I feel my already sore spine begin to lengthen and extend a little ways down the tail, new muscles and nerves stitching themselves together. It’s immensely painful and I scream again, hating the sound.  Finally, after what seems like eternity, I fall limp and welcome the pleasant abyss that comes with unconsciousness.

## Kapitel 4:
A slight, stinging pain; like a bee sting, all over wakes me up. Compared to earlier, this is nothing and it’s more of a surface pain than the deep burning of the gills and tail. I’m assuming it’s the scales, but I'm unable to lift my head to check. Not that I want to.

“That should be the last of them,” Jenny comments. I jump, a startled gasp escaping me. I didn’t know she was in here.

“The last of what?”

“Your scales sweetie. You’re a little late; your tail took longer than expected. You were supposed to be done around eleven. It’s two-thirty. But it looks like that’s the last of them coming in now. How are you feeling?”

“Awful. Tired. Sore. Like I'm going to be sick,” I mutter. The only bright side is that she’s right and the immediate pain fades, leaving me battered and sore, but wholly unharmed.

“I know, I'm sorry… oh. Oh, I didn’t know they did that!” She exclaims.

“What?” I ask, panicked.

“Your scales, even the ones on your chest; they used to be colorless, but when your tail stopped growing them, color bled into all of them and into your fin as well. It’s a really pretty-”

“Don’t tell me,” I interrupt. “I don’t want to know.”

“It’s high time you came to terms with all of this. You have no choice now,” Jenny states as she begins releasing me from all the restraints. “Dr. Auldon will be here any minute to take you to a tank.” She helps me sit up and forces my head to look down. I don’t bother closing my eyes, and am shocked by what I see. The tail looks surreal. It’s longer than what my legs were and lacks any definitive joints. My knees are gone. The fin isn’t two separate tailfins like in cartoons, but one large fluke of fish fin. The tips are long, thin, and curl inwards slightly. The scales gleam and shimmer. They are a rich amethyst color. The fin is lighter and brighter, more of an electric purple, with lavender veins running through it. The scales on my chest could almost resemble a sleeveless top. The straight band of them run just below my collarbone and taper off under my arms. They extend midway down my ribcage and are very effective at preserving modesty. To be honest, everything I was once worried about being visible is now hidden and I'm not even sure if it exists in the same manner anymore. I swallow the lump in my throat.

“How do you even work this thing?” I ask.

“You’ll have plenty of time to figure it out,” Jenny states. “You can swim right?”

“Yeah, of course, but that was with legs. I’ve never been especially great at dolphin kick and somehow I can’t see this being the same thing either.”

“No I imagine that it would be a little more difficult. Maybe instinct will kick in once you’re in the water.”

“And if it doesn’t?”

Jenny shrugs. “I doubt you’ll be left unattended in the beginning. Besides, you’ll have a teacher.”

“What if she doesn’t like me?” I inquire. “Would she attack me? If she figures out that I'm not really a mermaid?”

“I don’t know. I don’t know very much about her at all really.”

“That doesn’t really reassure me,” I reply. “I mean, what if-”

“I think that’s enough chit chat,” Dr. Auldon sneers, cutting me off and startling me. He and his goons have returned, another gurney is pushed by a man I haven’t seen before. “Miss Barnes, have you nothing better to do than sit around and talk to fish? And you,” Dr. Auldon’s gaze whips to me. “Don’t make me regret not having your vocal cords removed.” I bite my lip, but don’t reply. It would only get me into trouble. He nods. “Better. Miss Barnes, if you would be so kind as to get the creature loaded up, we’re ready to begin.”

“Of course,” Jenny forces a smile. She fixes me an apologetic look before picking me up. My tail hangs limply as she sets me down on the gurney. I’m still not really sure how to move it. Jenny pushes a hand against my collarbone and I lie back, not wanting to get either of us into trouble. My arms are restrained at the elbows and more restraints are placed at the base of my tailfin and across my hips.

Where do they expect me to go? Once I’ve been deemed immobile, the man who brought the gurney in pushes me out of the room. Dr. Auldon and Jenny follow.

“I thought that your experiments always resulted in a colorless tail and fin,” the unknown scientist comments. “Did you inject color under the scales or something?”

“We were going to, the tail was going to be green, but then this happened. I see no point in changing it now, the purple suits it fine.”

“Really? Well that’s fascinating. I wonder if it’s the consciousness of the girl’s mind that allowed for color. Your other human test subjects were all minimal brain wave coma patients, correct?”

“Yes, I suppose that is a possibility. Though I’m uncertain of why the color didn’t turn out the same as your mermaid.”

“Perhaps color and fin shape are not strictly genetic. They could be randomized features dependent on the omega gene.”

“It’s possible.”

“The omega gene?” Jenny asks. “What’s that?”

“A unique gene that these creatures possess. You see, most genetic hybrids are very unstable creations and most changes can only occur if the DNA is grafted onto a subject in the early stages of life when they are nothing more than a fertilized ovum. The reason we are able to graft mermaid DNA onto a grown host is because of the omega gene. So far they are the only species we’ve found to have it. It is a very submissive cell. So much so that no host body ever rejects it, but once inside and secure, it takes over. Dominates the host’s own genetic code and forces the mermaid genetics onto the host, triggering the change. It leaves no lasting damage to the host however and strives for the organism to survive and complete the transformation successfully. It is a massive discovery,” Dr. Auldon explains.

“Indeed,” the other scientist agrees. “And I am fascinated by your success with this subject.” His hands brush over my scales. “Very authentic. I doubt even another mermaid could tell the difference just by looking at her.” He presses his fingers into the side of my neck. Instead of being mildly uncomfortable, the motion is incredibly painful and I wince. It must be because of the gills. They must be very sensitive. One glance at the scientist tells me that he knows that and is trying to cause me pain. He grins and pushes harder. I whimper. “I don’t suppose you’d allow me a look inside her would you?”

Dr. Auldon grabs his hand and pulls it away from my neck. “Dr. Patron, you know full well that the mermaids are both falling under my care when the new tank is fully equipped. Until then, you are free to continue to study your own as long as she’s returned to the holding tank afterwards, but I would caution you to keep your hands to yourself when it comes to my specimen. She is not for public study.”

Gratitude sweeps through me at the kind gesture of protection, but it’s dashed when Dr. Auldon glares at me. He didn’t do it to protect me, he did it in an act of possessiveness and as an opportunity to show dominance towards the other scientist.

Dr. Patron grins, the sadistic gleam in his eyes makes me shudder. “Of course. I presume that the real thing is better than a copy anyways and I'll have to be sure to make the most of my time left with the little devilfish.”

The other mermaid.I realize, remembering the past conversation. He’s in charge of her.Knowing how he had tried to hurt me, with no provocation, and how happy he seemed while doing it, I instantly feel sorry for the mermaid. And Dr. Auldon had said that she had been here for six years, I wonder if she’s been Dr. Patron’s charge the whole time. I'm not given a chance to ponder it further because my attention is drawn to the doors that my gurney is pushed through. They lead into a very large, very tall room. Two huge identical cubed tanks stand attached to one another, but clearly separate boxes. The room has several large cranes probably used for moving heavy objects and animals around, as well as a bunch of different computers and machinery. I don’t want to know what any of it is for. The other mermaid is in the left tank. I’m not given the chance to see her enough to even describe her, only know that it’s too big and skinny for a regular fish and not proportioned to be a dolphin. She’s torn from my line of sight when the gurney is quickly spun around. There’s a man operating some of the machinery and with a loud cranking noise, one of the cranes lowers a green sling. The kind that are used to move dolphins and porpoises in and out of the water, except this one lacks the holes for the pectoral fins. I'm unstrapped from the gurney and placed into the sling. Conversation continues around me as I'm fitted into the sling and it’s prepped and checked.

“So have you decided on a stage name for the mermaid,” Dr. Auldon asks. “She’s your charge so it’s your decision as long as it appeals to the crowds.”

“I was considering Suzie. I had a dog named Suzie. Only creature I’ve ever been close to. What about for this one?”

“My team has been debating names, but I’ve decided on Bailey. I’ve always liked the name and it’s my niece’s daughter’s, name, so I think she’d like that.”

“Mhm.”

Bailey. I mull the name over. It could be worse, but I'm still not happy about the decision being made for me. Without warning the sling is lifted into the air. It’s a very disorienting feeling, being this high in the air with nothing holding me up but some fabric. I’m forced to flop around with the slight jerking of the sling as there’s nothing to use to straighten myself out and keep my balance. Too late I remember that they haven’t taught me to swim or how to use my gills. Panic grips my heart as there’s a click and the one side of the sling is released from the crane’s hold and I plummet down into the tank below. I hit the water on my side with a splash and sink. I just managed to fill my lungs before my head went under and I'm grateful for it now. I desperately try to propel myself to the surface, but the tail is heavy and I can’t get it to work enough to help me.

“Is she going to be okay in there?” Jenny asks. “What if she can’t use her gills?”

“Instinct will kick in,” Dr. Auldon states.

“And if it doesn’t?”

“Then she hasn’t been successfully changed and we find a new subject,” Dr. Patron states, his voice full of indifference. I continue to struggle without success, hurt that my life means so little to them.

“What about the other mermaid? Would she attack her? Can she jump the wall of the tank?”

Dr. Patron snorts. “I doubt the stupid beast knows how to jump. Being in a tank this large is a luxury for her. She’s being spoiled and she doesn’t deserve it.”

“I really think we should get Kat-Bailey out of there, she doesn’t look so good,” Jenny says.

She’s right. My lungs are screaming for oxygen and I haven’t been able to move from the floor of the tank. I hear a splash and Jenny shrieks and cries out, “I thought you said she wouldn’t jump!” Her words concern me and suddenly a thin pair of arms are wrapped around my waist.

The mermaid’s tail presses down on my own and she squeezes my stomach, forcing out the last few precious bubbles of oxygen that I have left. I futilely try to struggle as she attempts to drown me faster. But then her hands move to my neck, scratching lightly over the skin. I feel something pull away and suddenly I can breathe again. A hand is pressed over my mouth and nose to prevent me from inhaling. I'm grateful for it because otherwise I’d be choking on water.

I turn and come face to face with the other mermaid. Her wide eyes are full of concern. The vibrant shade of crystal blue makes her eyes look bigger than they really are. Her hair is a soft, wet sand shade of brown and falls down past her waist. Suddenly the hair extensions make sense, they wanted us to look alike in design. Her scales are a rich sapphire color and her fin is more of an ocean blue. She has no visible veins in her fin, but there are two symmetrical navy blue circles in the middle, with smaller white circles within those. Her fin is similar to mine, with the fluke-like shape of fin, but the tips of her tailfin are shorter and more rounded. Hers isn't as wide as mine, but it is longer by an inch or two. She’s a few years younger than me, probably between ten and fourteen years old. Her chest scales seem to have just started growing in because she only has a few rows of them, tiny and slightly dull, as though they haven’t come all the way in yet.

She hesitantly moves her hand away from my face and backs away, her gaze staring at the ground. She glances up at me shyly before returning her gaze to the floor. I continue to watch her. The way her fin ripples slightly, barely moving as it keeps her upright. She looks meant for the water, perfectly capable of moving around. I can’t help but reach out to attempt to touch her, to make sure she’s really there. She shies away from my hand.

She’s afraid of me.I realize. It’s then that I realize what it has been like for her. No one to trust. She’s been here for years and I doubt anyone has shown her any kindness. I look like the same species, technically I am now, yet she’s still afraid I'm going to try and hurt her. I turn to stare at the people behind the glass. My gaze trains on the scientist who did this to her, who took pleasure in hurting her. I notice her following my gaze. She bares her fangs and a hiss rings out through the water. Then she turns and swims to the far side of the tank, her back to the people staring in at us. I easily point out the brownish-green bruises that run the length of her spine. They were probably made from the extraction of her spinal fluid. I want to go over to her and give her a hug, but something tells me that would only frighten her, so I decide to keep my distance. Not that I can go anywhere anyways. I attempt to move my tail in the same way I saw her do it, but I have little success.

My efforts clearly don’t go unnoticed because she approaches me again, more slowly this time, and grabs my arm. She pulls me up and takes a hold of my fin, moving it back and forth so I can get a feel of it. Her eyes never leave mine, constantly checking and searching, clearly making sure that her actions are okay and I'm not going to attack her. I don’t understand the fear though. She seems to hate Dr. Patron and has no problem hissing at him, so why is she afraid of me? I look deep into her eyes and see her intelligence. See the hope behind the fear and understand. She’s afraid of me because I'm older, I'm bigger, but also because she’s been alone for so long that she’s afraid to upset me. Afraid I might hate her, hurt her, and ignore her like everyone else. She’s afraid of me in the same way I'm afraid of her.

She releases my fin and I continue to move it. She nods, satisfied and carefully touches my hips. She kicks her tail, her hips moving too and I realize her point. My hips are still the same, so I have no problem completing this task. I combine the two movements but I don’t really get anywhere. So she takes a hold of my tail again, bends it at a point I wouldn’t guess it could bend. It’s midway down the tail, lower than where my knees would be if I still had them. She continues to bend it like she did with my fin. It isn’t long before I can go up and, by throwing my weight forward into a flip, down. She helps me get into a more horizontal position and then I can go left and right without too much difficulty. Her fin brushes mine as she falls into place next to me, keeping pace with my slow stroke. Every time she moves, my fin instinctively follows her movements. It isn’t long before I can easily change direction and swim laps around the tank. I attempt to hug her, silently thank her, but she just shies away again and eventually jumps the barrier back into her own tank. I decide she wants time to herself and I leave her alone, continuing to practice on my own.

I swim a long time in a daze, lost in thought. And a soft knocking on the tank is what brings my attention back to reality. Jenny is standing on the other side of the glass. She points to a ladder that leads to a stand that overlooks both tanks, then point to the surface. She probably doesn’t think I can hear her. I nod and head towards the platform. She meets me up there.

“You’re looking pretty good out there,” she comments. “Adjusting okay?” I chew my lip and don’t answer. “It’s okay, no one else is in here, you won’t get into trouble. Are you hungry?”

“Starved,” I agree. “What’s for dinner?”

“Are you fond of sushi?”

“Not really,” I say. “Why.”

“I'm just following protocol. They’ve set you on a specific seafood diet,” She says as she pulls out a whole capelin from the tin bucket she’s carrying. I eye the fish with disgust. Scales and all, this fish looks recently dead and I don’t want it in my mouth. My stomach growls in complaint. I haven’t eaten in almost four days and IV supplements don’t do a thing to sate hunger. She tosses me the fish. “Sorry. You can have kelp too if you want it.” She pulls out some long, dark green tendrils and offers it to me. I hesitantly grab them. Then I hold up the fish.

“I don’t even know how to clean a fish. Can I eat the scales?”

“I’d assume so,” Jenny says. “Look if you want to forgo the fish tonight, you can, but that makes the kelp your dinner. Think carefully. You only get fed once a day in the evening. Either way, you will need to learn to like the fish, you need more nutrients than what kelp can offer.”

I sigh and reluctantly bite into the fish. The scales are crunchy and the flesh is a little goopy, but it doesn’t taste as bad as I thought. I take another bite, hunger making me gulp it down. Within seconds my fangs have sheared the meat off the, now clean, bones of the fish. All that remains is the head and tailfin. I dump it into the bucket and Jenny offers me another fish. I eat it just as fast as the other and gulp down the kelp. The slimy plant has a salty taste that is actually kind of pleasant. Jenny offers me a third and final fish.

The ladder shakes slightly as Dr. Patron ascends. He peers into the bucket at the leftover fish bones. “You using those?” he demands.

Jenny shakes her head. “No, why?”

Dr. Patron grins. “Perfect. Looks like you can have dinner after all, you stupid fish,” he calls out. “You can thank the handler for being kind enough to share.” He grabs the fish bones, void of any meat except for the head and fins, and tosses them into the other tank.

“Oh, sir, you can't seriously mean for that to be all you’re going to feed her!” Jenny exclaims.

“She’s being punished,” the man says, shrugging. “If you want to give her the bones of the other one after, fine, but nothing more.” I glare at him, my eyes following him as he climbs pack down the ladder, types something into the panel that I think controls the tank settings, and then walks away. Jenny shakes her head and sighs.

“Poor little girl. I’ll make sure she’s fed properly when you're both moved to the new tank. You both become my charges then. Try and save her some extra meat on that one okay?”

I nod. “Don’t worry, I will.”
Jenny nods and then climbs down the ladder and walks away, turning out the lights as she does.

I quickly learn that I can see in the dark. I watch the young mermaid as she tears at the fish carcass, trying to pull any meat she can from it. Her ribs jut out and she’s painfully thin. I know this isn’t the first time she’s been given little to no food. The real question is how long has it been since she had a proper meal? Without a second thought I throw the final fish over into the other tank. It’s the best I can do, but hopefully it will fill her belly a little more. I curl up at the bottom of the tank and watch her a little, before dozing off.

A while later, I wake with a start. It’s clearly very late and everything is quiet. What woke me up? My eyes fall on the girl in the other tank. She’s squished herself into a corner and is curled into a very tight ball.

Her whole body is shaking. I become worried that she might be having a minor seizure or something. I hurry to the surface and leap as high as I can. I actually manage to clear the glass and splash down into the other tank. As soon as I hit the water, I discover the source of the problem. The water is freezing, far colder than the water in my own tank. That bastard must have turned the heat settings way down.

If it’s so cold, why didn’t she just come into mine? I stare at her shivering form. She must still be afraid of me. She probably didn’t want to upset me by invading my space. That and she may think she’ll get into trouble with the scientists for coming into my tank. She probably would. I'm probably going to, but I'll take my chances. I dive and lie down beside her. She wakes up, clearly startled and tries to swim off. I pull her back down and curl around her, wrapping my arms around her thin waist to try to share my body heat with her. Her shivering lessens a little, but she still tries to pull away. I hug her, but let her go only seconds later. She rolls over to face me and I smile at her, before opening my arms again. If we are going to share a tank, she should know that I want to be her friend. She hesitates, but lies back down. She cuddles closer to me and quickly falls back asleep. I stroke her silky hair. It doesn’t take long for me to start thinking of her as a little sister. She doesn’t deserve to be here. No matter what it takes; I'll see her to freedom even if it costs me mine, permanently.
